## Theme
```shell
Crisis Response
```

# Problem Statement

As the pandemic is now at its peak all across the country and since no speculations can be made about opening of educational institutions or offices, the major problem lies for the employees and students while completing their assigned tasks. Another problem that these sections of population face are lack of motivation to complete their work on time and procrastination. In some sectors, employee payments are also based on the working duration of the employee, this becomes a trouble as now it is difficult to regulate the actual working hours of the employees.

# Proposed Solution
We propose to  create a web application  to solve majority of the problems. This website will have features for the users to keep a track of their schedules and get incentives on meeting deadlines. It will also include embedded features such as a platform on which colleagues can interact with each other to keep their professional and personal communication distinctly, and will also have a chill out page where they can relax for times breaks.

# Objective
Our idea deals with the major issue the entire nation is facing currently, WORK FROM HOME. This ideology was developed to combat the pandemic situation. Our motivation to work on this project is that a lot of students and colleagues are not able to complete their work efficiently. Our purpose is to solve this issue in a manner that they can schedule their tasks and take a break thereby completing their tasks smoothly.


# Application

```

```

# Implementation
We plan to implement the following features on the website:
1. A resourceful page wherein the user can browse for motivational content or his own if need be.
1. A chatbot specifically for professional purposes so that professional and personal communication can be kept separate.
1. A routine scheduler and goal setter where the user can schedule his day along with goals and get incentives of achieving them. At the end of the day, a generated report can be sent to the organisation of the employee stating the entire day’s goals achieved.
1. Take – a –break corner where different social media options will be displayed for the user to take a timed break. Once the time limit is reached, the website would redirect to the home page
